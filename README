# LANDING PAGE SIMPLES

With the aim of developing practice, this project involves the HTML markup language and CSS styling.

In this project, HTML structuring skills were developed so that logical sequences of tags were used, in addition to semantic HTML.

CSS was developed with the aim of practicing flexbox and its properties, as well as providing notions of measurements for a web page.
